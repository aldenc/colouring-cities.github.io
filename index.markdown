Colouring Cities platforms are also being tested in Baharin, Colombia, Germany, Lebanon and Sweden. More information on individual platforms is available in the Colouring Cities Research Programme's [GitHub Open Manual](https://github.com/colouring-cities/manual/wiki/B.-CCRP-INTERNATIONAL-RESEARCH-PARTNERS-;-links,-resources,-protocols-&-meeting-dates)

The CCRP has been set up at the [Alan Turing Instititute](https://www.turing.ac.uk) - the UK's National Institute for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence - to facilitate the sharing of knowledge and data about buildings at national and international level. 
The aim of the research programme is to increase stock quality, sustainability, efficiency and resilience, to support the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, and to assist communities and other stakeholders in this process. 
The CCRP also looks to effect a step-change in the amount and type of building level attribute data available for use in scientific research specifically, and in the application of AI and machine learning, to advance understanding of the stock as a complex dynamic system.
