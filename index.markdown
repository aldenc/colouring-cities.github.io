## The Colouring Ciyties Research Programme - Overview**

The Colouring Cities Research Programme (CCRP) designs and tests open tools that facilitate knowledge and data sharing on the composition, performance and dynamics of building stocks, across sectors, disciplines and countries. The CCRP is run by the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/about-us), the UK's National Institute of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence which was set up to make great leaps in data science and artificial intelligence research in order to change the world for the better. 

Colouring Cities platforms are specifically designed to effect a step change in the range, scale, quality and accessibility of building level, spatial building attribute data:
* to help improve stock quality, sustainability, efficiency and resilience in line with the [United Nations' [Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) and [New Urban Agenda](https://habitat3.org/the-new-urban-agenda/);
* to support AI applications that provide insights into the stock as a complex dynamic system, and to identify underlying rules, patterns and cycles operating in stocks ,that lead to sustainable and unssustainable, trajectories;
* to develop and test an academic governance model for independently managed, networked platforms able to collectively deliver a global building database able to supporting building atttribute data analysis and comparison across countries 
* to  atest the use iof  colour and feedback loops between computational approaches and crowdsourcing methods to engage diverse stakeholders in the process of platform development to maximise the accuracy, granularity, range and geographic coverage of data 
* to advance ethical, reproducible, and collaborative data science, as set out in [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome.htmlsupport).

The CCRP is a branded research programme that brings together academic researchers, already involved in building stock research, from across countries to pool knowledge, and co-work on and test open-source code,for Colouring Cities platforms. Each CCRP platform is managed and funded independently by each academic partner or academic consortium, at country level, and follows an agreed set of [CCRP protocols](https://github.com/colouring-cities/manual/wiki/B.-International-research-partners;-links,-resources,-protocols-&-meeting-dates) drafted by the Alan Turing Institute. The CCRP releases its core code, and additional country specific code, via GitHub. Its standardised open building attribute datasets are accessible via its international platform network.

Colouring Cities platforms collect, collate, visualise, verify, and release over 120 categories of spatial building attribute data. These are grouped into 12 subject areas, as shown below. Selection of subcategories is based on analysis of academic papers relating to sustainability science, urban science, resilience analysis and urban complexity, UK stakeholder consultation on the Colouring London prototype (2015-19), international partner consultation and live platform testing. New subcategories are added in consultation with CCRP academic partners. Four data capture methods are experimented with: bulk upload of open public datasets, live streaming from public sources, computational generation using inference (with upload moderated by academic partners), and crowdsourcing at building level, contributed and verified by diverse stakeholders. Through this process issues such as data fragmentation, incompleteness, inaccessibility, aggregation,inconsistency, security and privacy are explored and addressed. Data accuracy is maximised through feedback loops between data capture methods, and verification tools.

Colouring Cities platforms use building footprints, of the highest quality, openness and geographic coverage available, as their basic building block. As well as providing information on the shape and size of buildings, footprints act as mini filing cabinets, allowing information to be easily captured, collated, verified and visualised. Live co-creation of maps through the colouring-in of footprints forms a key feature of platform design. 

[Alan Turing](https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/what-alan-turing-means-us) argued that "_the isolated individual does not develop any intellectual power  â€¦The search for new techniques must be regarded as carried out by the human community as a whole, rather than by individuals_".  The CCRP programme brings together collaborators from across sectors, communities and countries, and from science, the humanities and the arts to help solve complex problems relating to cities and to building stocks. It looks to capture knowledge from as many individuals and organisations as possible involved in the practical design, construction, management, monitoring, conservation, retrofitting, from citizens using/living in buildings, as well as from many areas of academic research. These include data science, computer science and software engineering, urban science, industrial ecology, urban morphology, physics, environmental science, material science, climate change resilience, building construction, engineering, conservation, housing, planning, architecture, history, architectural history, graphic design and colour theory, as well as into open data models, data ethics, artificial intelligence & machine learning, computer vision, procedural modelling, the mathematics of cities, and GIS and spatial data. 



- The Colouring Cities Research Programme (CCRP) develops open-source code for knowledge sharing platforms providing spatial data across countries on the composition, performance and dynamics of building stocks. 

- The aim of the CCRP is to provide open tools to improve stock quality, sustainability, efficiency and resilience, in line with United Nations New Urban Agenda and Sustainable Development Goals. Large-scale databases are also urgently needed to help drive AI and machine learning applications that insights into the stock as a complex, dynamic system, and into underlying rules, cycles and patterns operating in it to improve predictive models. 

- The CCRP tests an a low-cost, distributed management, academic governance model for networked open data platforms providing standardised building attribute datasets for use in socio-0economic and environmental research. It integrates data capture methods including computational approaches uses inference, crowdsourcing from expert sources at building level, and live streaming, and tests feedback loops between these to maximise attribute range, geographic coverage, data accuracy, granularity and standardisation and platform accessibility. 

- The Colouring Cities Research Programme is overseen from the UK by The Alan Turing Institute (the UK's National Institute for Data Science & Artificial Intelligence) and is being developed by an international academic consortium which brings togethers researchers involved in diverse areas of the buildings stock as well as research software engineers and academics with AI expertise.

## **Academic networks and hubs**
As the number of countries involved in the CCRP expands, Global Region Hubs will be set-up to bring together and support discussion between academic institutions testing Colouring Cities platforms, and to help to encourage and track use of CCRP data in socio-economic and environmental research. Three hubs, operating within similar time zones, are proposed:
* Asia & Australasia
* Europe & the Middle East
* North, Central & South America

## **CCRP Quality control and platform interoperability**
CCRP branding is tightly controlled to maintain programme and platform quality, and to maximise user trust. Branding is also important as platform code is open-source, with experimentation by software developers and engineers encouraged. The CCRP provides the necessary space to allow international research partners to co-design and test platforms to the highest standards, to explore the potential value of captured building attribute data in many areas of socio-economic and environmental reseach, and to ensure ethical considerations are prioritised. Clear branding is also necessary to allow the purpose, principles, and quality and of Colouring Cities platforms to be instantly understood regardless of which country a Colouring Cities platform is set up in. Improvements to interface design and content are ongoing and incremental, building on findings from the CCRP group. CCCP partners use identical interfaces and main data category keypads to maximise clarity and interoperability of systems. Where platforms differ is in additional subcategory inclusion relevant to national/regional contexts, open-source code for which is also available within the CCRP GitHub repository. 

CCRP research partners can be identified by their exclusive use of the Colouring Cities logo, and their inclusion on this page, and n the [Alan Turing Institute CCRP webpage](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/colouring-london-and-colouring-cities-research-programme).  No other applications of Colouring Cities code, interface design or logo are endorsed by the Alan Turing Institute.
