- The Colouring Cities Research Programme (CCRP) develops open-source code for open knowledge sharing Colouring Cities platforms that provide spatial data across countries on the composition, performance and dynamics of building stocks. 

- The aim of the CCRP is to provide open tools to improve stock quality, sustainability, efficiency and resilience, in line with United Nations New Urban Agenda and Sustainable Development Goals. Large-scale databases are also urgently needed to help drive AI and machine learning applications that insights into the stock as a complex, dynamic system, and into underlying rules, cycles and patterns operating in it to improve predictive models. 

- The CCRP tests an a low-cost, distributed management, academic governance model for networked open data platforms providing standardised building attribute datasets for use in socio-0economic and environmental research. It integrates data capture methods including computational approaches uses inference, crowdsourcing from expert sources at building level, and live streaming, and tests feedback loops between these to maximise attribute range, geographic coverage, data accuracy, granularity and standardisation and platform accessibility. 

- The Colouring Cities Research Programme is overseen from the UK by The Alan Turing Institute (the UK's National Institute for Data Science & Artificial Intelligence) and is being developed by an international academic consortium which brings togethers researchers involved in diverse areas of the buildings stock as well as research software engineers and academics with AI expertise.

## **Academic networks and hubs**
As the number of countries involved in the CCRP expands, Global Region Hubs will be set-up to bring together and support discussion between academic institutions testing Colouring Cities platforms, and to help to encourage and track use of CCRP data in socio-economic and environmental research. Three hubs, operating within similar time zones, are proposed:
* Asia & Australasia
* Europe & the Middle East
* North, Central & South America

## **CCRP Quality control and platform interoperability**
CCRP branding is tightly controlled to maintain programme and platform quality, and to maximise user trust. Branding is also important as platform code is open-source, with experimentation by software developers and engineers encouraged. The CCRP provides the necessary space to allow international research partners to co-design and test platforms to the highest standards, to explore the potential value of captured building attribute data in many areas of socio-economic and environmental reseach, and to ensure ethical considerations are prioritised. Clear branding is also necessary to allow the purpose, principles, and quality and of Colouring Cities platforms to be instantly understood regardless of which country a Colouring Cities platform is set up in. Improvements to interface design and content are ongoing and incremental, building on findings from the CCRP group. CCCP partners use identical interfaces and main data category keypads to maximise clarity and interoperability of systems. Where platforms differ is in additional subcategory inclusion relevant to national/regional contexts, open-source code for which is also available within the CCRP GitHub repository. 

CCRP research partners can be identified by their exclusive use of the Colouring Cities logo, and their inclusion on this page, and n the [Alan Turing Institute CCRP webpage](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/colouring-london-and-colouring-cities-research-programme).  No other applications of Colouring Cities code, interface design or logo are endorsed by the Alan Turing Institute. Information on CCRP resources provided by The Alan Turing Insititute and Academic Partner Protocols acam be found [here](https://github.com/colouring-cities/manual/wiki/B.-CCRP-INTERNATIONAL-RESEARCH-PARTNERS-;-links,-resources,-protocols-&-meeting-dates).
