- The Colouring Cities Research programme (CCRP) has been set up at the [Alan Turing Instititute](https://www.turing.ac.uk) - the UK's National Institute for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence - to facilitate the sharing of knowledge and data about buildings at national and international level. 

- Our aim is to increase stock quality, sustainability, efficiency and resilience, to support the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, and to assist communities and other stakeholders in this process. 

- We also look to effect a step-change in the amount and type of building level attribute data available for use in research and practice , and in the application of AI and machine learning to advance understanding of the stock as a complex dynamic system.

- The CCRP tests an a low-cost, distributed management, academic governance model for interopereable open building attribute data platforms. This involves specialist departments within international academic institutions specialising in research into building stock composition, performance and/or dynamic behaviour, co-working on core platform design and code, and on data analysis; Lead institutions are as follows: 

- Colouring Australia: [Colouring Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth](https://www.colouringaustralia.org)
The University of New South Wales

- Colouring Britain: [Colouring London](https://colouring.london)
The Alan Turing Institute

- Colouring Germany: [Colouring Dresden](https://colouring.dresden.ioer.de/view/sustainability)

- Colouring Greece: [Colouring Athens](https://athens.colouringcities.org/)

- Colouring Indonesia [Colouring Bandung](https://indonesia.colouringcities.org)

- Live Colouring Cities platforms will also soon be activated in Colombia, Lebanon and Sweden and Bahrain.

If you are an academic insitution interested in joining the Colouring Cities Research Programme, in a country not yet represented, and in using our Colouring Cities open code for collaborative research purposes, please contact Polly Hudson at phudson@turing.ac.uk. If you would like to partner with a specific Colouring Cities platfom please contact the Principal Investigator for the relevant country- details of which are available in our[Open Manual](https://github.com/colouring-cities/manual/wiki)
